Simple Linear Regression from Scratch : 
This repository contains Python code for implementing simple linear regression from scratch. Simple linear regression is a fundamental technique in statistical learning and machine learning, used to understand the relationship between two continuous variables. This implementation aims to provide a clear, easy-to-understand example of how linear regression works without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn.

Features
> Implementation: The core of this project is the implementation of simple linear regression using basic Python and numpy for numerical computations.
> Dataset: Includes a sample dataset for testing the implementation.
> Visualization: Demonstrates the results through visualization using matplotlib.
